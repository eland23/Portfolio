				<h2>Hi, I'm Eric Landaverde</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Academic and Professional</h3>
				<p> I am 22 year old college student born and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Currently, I am a senior studying computer science at Kean University where I plan to continue by education 
					and attend graduate school to complete my masters degree. I spent my time at Kean University as an undergraduate student researcher, which has afforded me many opportunities to develop my technical and communication skills which I used
					to develop various research projects with my peers and present this research at various conferences around the United States. This hard work and dedication to academic and personal excellence has made me the Kean Undergraduate Student Researcher of the Year for 2023, 
					National Conference on Undergraduate Research Poster Contest Winner 2022, and the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) Student Scholar 2022-2023. I have also been dedicated to promoting research activities at Kean University through my role 
					as the President of the National Cybersecurity Student Association student group, and as a speaker at events such as the 2022 ACM Hackathon at Kean, 2021 Explore CS event, and through speaking to classes of first-year computer science students. My future aspirations 
					include obtaining my masters and doctoral degree in the area of learning analytics or articial intelligence, as well as entering the industry as a data scientist or machine learning engineer and eventually starting my own software company with the goal of advancing 
					the potential of human learning and optimize the utilization of information.   </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Personal</h3>
				<p>Some of my hobbies include running, weightlifting, and hiking. I love the feeling of running and the mental alone time I get when I go on long runs. Not everyone is fortunate enough to get the feeling of runners high, but if you look at running as the privilege to suffer, you realize 
					how peaceful and freeing it can be. I am also a big fan of strength sports like strong man, powerlifting, and more generally extreme strength and endurance sports like ultra marathons and triathalons like Ironmans. I aspire to be one of those athletes that choose to puch themsleves and learn
				something new about who they are when the going gets rough. Whether I ever make it to the levels of the greats in those sports like Courtney Dauwalter, Brian Shaw, and mental warriors like David Goggins and Cameron Hanes, I wish to look back at my life when its all said and done and be satisfied that 
			I gave my time on this earth my all. </p>
			<p>
				My interests are wide and varied, but I am most passionate about topics such as personal knowledge management, learning analytics, artificial intelligence, and human performance. I believe all these are based on my interest in the intersection of technology and society, and how we can use technology to improve
				the lives of people around the world in various areas. I find interest in various other topics such as philosophy, psychology, and history and their role in different areas such as fashion, art, sports, and food. I find enjoyment out of exploring a variety of different topics and their history, evolution, and significance to
				people who are most passionate about them. Many of  these topics have a rich and deep history and complexity to them and nothing is more amazing than the infectious passion that people who are deeply involved in these areas express when they talk about them. I see myself as a lifelong learner and I hope to continue to learn 
				and grow as a person and explore what I and many others are passionate about.
